## Getting Started

### Installation

With node installed, carefully type this in your terminal and hit enter:

```
npm install
```

### Running Prod

To get a production build going and start the server, run:

```
npm start
```

### Running Dev

To start your dev environment, run:

```
npm run dev
```

This should do just about the same as a Production run, but with some watchers and browser-sync to speed up the dev workflow.
